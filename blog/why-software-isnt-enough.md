# The limits of software

With a gazillion sites on their books, strata managers depend on software to stay organised.  
Software like Strata Master, Urbanise, and SMATA are all excellent tools for tracking jobs and due dates.  
But can software walk through a site?  
Is it on the ground at regular intervals, noticing the small issues before they escalate?  
We think not!

A system might show a list of completed tasks, but without eyes on the ground, does a strata manager know with certainty whether a light was replaced or an extinguisher was tagged correctly?  
Over time, that small disconnect creates big compliance risks.

# Data vs reality

Software is essential, no doubt, but the moment data and reality drift apart, strata managers are left exposed during inspections, insurance renewals, and AFSS reviews.

Physical verification absolutely matters.  
A simple site visit or photo report closes the loop between what the system records and what is actually true.

# Our approach

Our strata support services do not replace your existing platforms; they complement them.  
Weâ€™re on site at consistent times, capturing images, logging issues, and making sure every certificate and report is ready before the deadline.

Our teams ensure that what you see on screen matches what is happening at every building you manage.
