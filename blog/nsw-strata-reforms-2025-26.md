## NSW Strata Reforms 2025–26

Big changes are coming to NSW strata law. New rules for managers, owners, and committees are about to apply, so here’s what’s changing and why it matters. Get ahead before changes kick in.

Strata laws in NSW are shifting big time.

For strata managers, committees, and building owners, we won’t lie, it’s going to get tough. It means more enforcement and bigger expectations all round.

Managing contractors and compliance is more than a full-time job, and the schemes that stay ahead of that hectic juggling act rely on structured support, including consistent inspections, clear reporting, and an on-site delegate accountable for closing the loop between reminders and results.

# Here’s what’s changing

From 1 July 2025 until 1 April 2026, new rules will roll out in stages:

- Strata managers, building managers, and service providers must declare any financial interests or supplier links so committees can spot conflicts.
- Owners' corporations have stronger powers to end or vary management agreements or building manager contracts when standards slip.
- Levy notices must include financial hardship information, and schemes must handle payment-plan requests fairly.
- The duty to repair and maintain common property has been strengthened, and delays in carrying out maintenance can now lead to greater liability.
- The timeframe for owners to claim over failures has also been extended.

These reforms mean more checklists and more visibility for everyone involved. For the building you manage, they also mean less margin for error.

# Why strata support has never been more important

With these changes:

- Committees will ask for proof of compliance, not just “yes, the jobs have been done.”
- If something goes wrong, the owners' corporation and strata manager will face tougher scrutiny.
- Schemes will need clearer records, transparent processes, and visible follow-through.

The gap isn’t just “who cleans and mows” — it’s now, “who is meeting regulations, and who can show it.”

# What effective strata support looks like

- Site inspections (monthly or quarterly) to check lighting, access, gardens, waste areas, and required signage.
- Photo-based reports that show what’s been done, what needs attention, and what can wait.
- Job coordination so managers don’t have to chase multiple contractors.
- Issue logging for small items like loose tiles, leaks, or damaged fittings before they become major repair bills.
- Digital record-keeping for certificates, AFSS data, and safety checks.
- Direct communication with strata managers so every site update is documented and easy to reference.

When your processes align with the law, you protect the building, the committee, and your role.

# What managers can do now

- Review your current agreements and define responsibilities clearly.
- Check your records for photo evidence and digital logs.
- Update contract templates and service schedules to match 2025–26 changes.
- Refine your reporting (can you show committees what was done and when?).
- Choose a support partner or resource now, before deadlines hit.

# The bottom line

Change is coming fast in NSW strata, and the legal bar is rising.  
Good software helps you track.
