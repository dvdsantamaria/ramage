# Seeing Is Believing: Why Strata Needs Photo-Based Proof

How often do you see a postie or courier take a photo of a parcel for delivery proof? So why aren’t strata services providing the same level of transparency?

Here’s how to stop repeat issues, simplify audits, and build trust with committees.

We know first-hand that regular inspections and photo-based reports help committees see progress clearly, and we know that prevents those ugly disputes. Imagine that!

Here’s a fun fact: 98% of our quotes have converted to long-term clients since introducing our clearly marked-up photo quotes.

That’s because visual reports turn maintenance quotes and cleaning updates into clear, evidence-based records that committees instantly understand. Instead of debating whether a job was completed, everyone can see it. No questions. All as clear as day.

Photo-based reporting builds trust. It shows progress, documents condition, and provides proof for AFSS, insurance, or warranty claims.

More importantly for managers juggling multiple sites, it reduces the endless back-and-forth questions from owners.

At Ramage Property Services, our Strata Support reports include before-and-after images, timestamps, and notes, creating a permanent record that stays with the property.
