# Photo Reporting Power

If couriers take photos for proof of delivery, strata services should do the same. Visual reporting closes the trust gap, showing exactly what was cleaned, trimmed, or fixed on the day.

We walk through the simple workflow our teams follow, the types of shots that matter most to managers, and how photo archives make audits and insurance queries far less stressful.

Adopt photo-based updates and you will never have to rely on a checklist alone again. It is accountability, transparency, and peace of mind in one quick step.
