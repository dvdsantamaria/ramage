## If the words ‘AFSS’ and ‘lodgement’ give you an instant shudder, read on

Keeping up with testing dates and safety regulations for multiple sites, all with different renewal cycles, is a legitimate nightmare. Here’s a simple checklist to help avoid delayed certificates (and reduce that dreaded audit stress).

Welcome to the practical checklist that keeps your property on track year-round.

## Start with your AFSS anniversary date

Your Annual Fire Safety Statement (AFSS) is due every 12 months on or before the anniversary of the previous lodgement, meaning your starting point should aways be backwards from that date:

- Six months out: schedule fire-safety testing.
- Three months out: verify repairs and update logbooks.
- One month out: finalise certificates and sign the AFSS.

## Monthly tasks

- Walk common areas for safety or lighting issues.
- Review contractor reports and update digital records.
- Keep all photos, certificates, and test reports in one folder.

## Six-month tasks

- Test exit lights for the full 90-minute duration (do not skimp!)
- Check hose reels, hydrants, and extinguishers. Upload photos to the folder.
- Inspect bin rooms, stairways, and plant areas for obstructions.

## Annual tasks

- Confirm contractors are FPAS-accredited (you’d be surprised!)
- Review your fire-safety schedule and insurance reports.
- Test and tag electrical equipment per AS/NZS 3760.

Most strata managers already use software like Strata Master or Urbanise for reminders. What matters is turning those reminders into verified, photo-backed records. A quick site review or an independent inspection before your AFSS lodgement can make the difference between a calm audit and a last-minute panic attack!

Complying with NSW regulations is demanding, but it doesn’t need to be overwhelming.

If your schedule ever feels too tight, our Strata Support team can help with inspections, coordination, and digital record keeping.
