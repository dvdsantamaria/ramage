# Strata Compliance Checklist (101)

Compliance can feel overwhelming, but it does not have to. We distilled the essentials into a simple, step-by-step checklist that keeps AFSS renewals and safety checks front of mind, months before they are due.

From extinguishers and hose reels to exit lights and logbooks, each item includes the recommended frequency, responsible party, and what photo evidence helps committees sign off with confidence. No more last-minute scrambles or missing certificates.

Use this guide to map out the year, assign responsibilities, and maintain a tidy audit trail so every annual sign-off is calm, predictable, and fully compliant.
