## Cleaner, Caretaker, or Support?

Hiring a caretaker is a decision made by the strata scheme's owners' corporation, and in the majority of cases in NSW, committees simply do not have the funds for such a luxury.

Then there are cleaning contracts that cover basic surface cleaning, vacuuming, and mopping (and let’s be honest, in a lot of cases, “basic” is being kind).

And somewhere in between lies the level of support most buildings truly need.

# So, breaking it down

A cleaner focuses on presentation (floors, windows, railings, and bins in common areas).

A caretaker manages daily operations, trades, and an ongoing list of resident gripes.

A support team handles the practical middle ground that strata managers spend most of their time pulling their hair out over: inspections, minor maintenance, compliance tracking, and reporting.

# For the majority of small and medium schemes, a flexible support option is the way to go

It offers professional oversight without the cost or formality of a long-term caretaker contract.

Here’s why it’s the way to go:

- Routine site inspections every month or quarter to check lighting, access, gardens, waste areas, and safety signage.
- Photo-based reports that show what has been completed, what needs attention, and what can wait, giving committees a clear visual record.
- Job coordination so managers don’t have to chase multiple contractors. We follow up on quotes, verify completion, and close the loop.
- Issue logging for small maintenance items like loose tiles, leaks, or damaged fittings before they become major repair bills.
- Digital record keeping that keeps all certificates, AFSS data, and safety checks in one place, ready for audits or committee reviews.
- Direct communication with strata managers so every site update is documented and easy to reference.
