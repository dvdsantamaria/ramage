            <em> How do we collect your data? </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some data are collected when you provide them to us. This could, for
            example, be data you enter in a contact form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other data are collected automatically by our IT systems when you
            visit and use our website. These data are primarily technical data
            such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you
            accessed the website. These data are collected automatically as soon
            as you enter our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em> What do we use your data for? </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of
            the website. Other data can be used to analyze how visitors use the
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em> What rights do you have regarding your data? </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            You always have the right to request information about your stored
            data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection
            at no charge. You also have the right to request that your data be
            corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time using
            the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions
            about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of
            course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.

          <p>
            When visiting our website, statistical analyses may be made of your
            surfing behavior. This happens primarily using cookies and
            analytics. The analysis of your surfing behavior is usually
            anonymous, encrypted, and pseudonimized, meaning that we will not be
            able to identify you through this data. You can object to this
            analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. Detailed
            information can be found in the following privacy policy.

          <p>
            The operators of this website take the protection of your personal
            data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and
            in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and
            this privacy policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use this website, various kinds of personal data will be
            collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be
            personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information

          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email
            communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete
            protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Notice concerning the party responsible for this website</h3>
          </div>
          <p>The party responsible for processing data on this website is:</p>
          <p>
            The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or
            jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing
            personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
            consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect.
            An informal email making this request is sufficient. Please note
            that data processed before we receive your request may still be
            legally processed.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the
            affected person may file a complaint with the competent regulatory
            authorities.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            You have the right to have data which we process based on your
            consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to
            yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format.
            If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible
            party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for
            the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as
            the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize
            an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it
            changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed
            in your browser's address bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us
            cannot be read by third parties.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Encrypted payments on this website</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            If you enter into a contract which requires you to send us your
            payment information (e.g. account number for direct debits), we will
            require this data to process your payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard,
            direct debit) are only made via encrypted SSL or TLS connections.
            You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address
            line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon
            in your browser line is visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of encrypted communication, any payment details you
            submit to us cannot be read by third parties.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Information, blocking, deletion</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time
            with information free of charge about any of your personal data that
            is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for
            which it has been processed. You also have the right to have your
            data be corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any
            time using the address given in our legal notice if you have further
            questions on the topic of personal data.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Opposition to promotional emails</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in
            the context of website legal notice requirements with regard to
            sending promotional and informational materials not expressly
            requested. The website operator reserves the right to take specific
            legal action if unsolicited advertising material, such as email
            spam, is received.

          <p>
            Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer
            and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more
            user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files
            that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are
            automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your
            device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it
            possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of
            cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to
            accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be
            configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions
            or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when
            closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality
            of this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to
            provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping
            cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of the EU
            DSGVO/GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the
            storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of
            technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze
            your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated
            separately in this privacy policy.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Server log files</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            The website provider automatically collects and stores information
            that your browser automatically transmits to us in "server log
            files". These are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span> Browser type and browser version </span>

              <span> IP address </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
          <p>
            The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) of the EU DSGVOGDPR,
            which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for
            measures preliminary to a contract.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Contact form</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Should you send us questions via contact form on our website, we
            will collect the data entered on in the form, including the contact
            details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up
            questions. We do not share this information without your permission.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will, therefore, process any data you enter in the contact form
            only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) of the EU DSGVOGDPR. You
            may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this
            request is sufficient. Data processed before we receive your request
            may still be legally processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will retain the data you provide in the contact form until you
            request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the
            purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling
            your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those
            regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by
            this provision.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            We collect, process, and use personal data only insofar as it is
            necessary to establish, or modify legal relationships with us
            (master data). This is done based on Art. 6 (1) (b) of the EU

            This website uses the open source web analytics service Matomo.
            Matomo uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are
            stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the
            website by you. For this purpose, the information generated by the
            cookie about the use of this website is stored on our server. The IP
            address is anonymized before it is stored.
          </p>
          <p>Matomo cookies remain on your device until you delete them.</p>
          <p>
            The storage of Matomo cookies is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) of the EU
            DSGVOGDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
            analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and
            its advertising.

            these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in
            your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean
            you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this

            stored in your browser to prevent Matomo from storing your usage
            data. If you delete your cookies, this will mean that the opt-out
            cookie will also be deleted. You will then need to reactivate it

            If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid
            email address as well as information that allows us to verify that
            you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree
            to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is
            only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send
            the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will, therefore, process any data you enter in the contact form
            only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) of the EU DSGVOGDPR. You
            can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as
            well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g.
            through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The data processed
            before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
          </p>

            The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used
            to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when
            said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes
            (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.

          </p>
          <p>
            To use Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This
            information is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA
            and stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on this
            data transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of Google Maps is in the interest of making our website
            appealing and to facilitate the location of places specified by us
            on the website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to
            Art. 6 (1) (f) of the EU DSGVOGDPR.
